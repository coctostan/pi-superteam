description: Chain scout and implementer to explore then implement
---
Use the team tool in chain mode:

1. First, dispatch scout to understand the current codebase related to: $@
2. Then, dispatch implementer with task: "Based on the following codebase analysis, implement: $@. Codebase context: {previous}"

Follow TDD strictly throughout.
