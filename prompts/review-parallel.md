description: Dispatch parallel review agents on specified files or directory

Use the team tool in parallel mode to dispatch review agents:

1. spec-reviewer: verify implementation matches requirements
2. quality-reviewer: check code quality and test quality

Target: $@

Synthesize the findings from both reviewers and summarize any issues that need attention.
