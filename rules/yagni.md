YAGNI: You Aren't Gonna Need It.

Do NOT add functionality for anticipated future requirements. Implement ONLY what is needed right now, as specified in the current task. Extra abstractions, unused parameters, and speculative features add complexity without value.

If a future need arises, it can be added then — with its own tests.
