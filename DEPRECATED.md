# pi-superteam is deprecated (sunset)

**Status:** Deprecated / unmaintained.

I’m sunsetting **pi-superteam**. It turned out to be overly ambitious and ultimately misses the mark. The package will remain published for existing users, but it will receive:

- No new features
- No bug fixes
- No security updates

## Recommended alternatives

If you want a lighter-weight approach, use one of these instead:

- **pi-superpowers**
  - npm: https://www.npmjs.com/package/pi-superpowers
  - GitHub: https://github.com/coctostan/pi-superpowers
- **pi-superpowers-plus**
  - npm: https://www.npmjs.com/package/pi-superpowers-plus
  - GitHub: https://github.com/coctostan/pi-superpowers-plus
  - Adapted for Obra/Superpowers users coming to pi

## What to do if you currently depend on pi-superteam

- **Pin** to a known-good version in your project.
- **Fork** this repo if you need changes.
- Consider migrating your workflows/config to one of the alternatives above.
